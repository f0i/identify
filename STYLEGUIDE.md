## Typography
- Font family: Mina, Arial, sans-serif
- Body font size: 15px

## Buttons

- Padding: 12px 24px
- Primary button: Green with slight gradient (linear-gradient(135deg, #4CAF50, #45a049))

## Layout
- Flexbox for centering
- Responsive design with media queries (min-width 800px, max-width 800px)
- Content containers with white background, box-shadow, border-radius 12px
- Improve unification: Reduce separators (e.g., soften hr), use consistent spacing, connect sections visually

- Ensure consistent alignment and spacing throughout
